Execute install.sh in the root directory of project.
Then do chgrp and chown as it is suggested by the script output.
It will generate erl.sh. Make sure that you run erl.sh from the
directory where it's placed.
To run the thing you will have to start yaws, descriptors and
pollbox:


```

	application:start(yaws).
	pollbox:start().
	descriptors:start().


````

Make sure that you don't run erl.sh as root and that you have 
changed yaws.conf.
I haven't tested the (partly-)automated installation, so mail
me about bugs either in example, installation script or the
erlongpoll library itself.
